### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caregenix.git
   cd caregenix
2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Run the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app. The page will reload automatically when you make changes.

4. **Build for Production**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   This creates an optimized production build in the build folder, ready for deployment.

5. **Run Tests**

   ```bash
   npm test
   Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### üöÄ Deployment
To deploy the app on Netlify:

 1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.

 2. Connect the repository to Netlify via the Netlify dashboard.

 3. Configure the build settings:

    . Build command: npm run build
